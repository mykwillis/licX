License Express™ for .NET™ provides a simple and affordable licensing 
solution for developers of applications and components for the Microsoft 
.NET platform.  In 15 minutes, License Express™ can be integrated into 
your project, preventing it from being used without the presence of a 
valid license key.

With simple drag-and-drop integration, support for evaluation licenses, 
custom handling of licensing failure events, and premiere tech support, 
License Express™ is the perfect way to license your .NET-based product.
Whether you've got a killer component ready to be redistributed with a 
thousand host applications, or a slick new Windows Forms application, 
License Express™ can license it - quickly and easily.


Where to Start?
---------------
The License Express™ User's Guide is the best place to start, and can be 
accessed with the Start menu.  Traverse the Start menu to All Programs, 
Wanderlust Software, License Express™, and select License Express™ User's 
Guide.  If you are the type of person that likes to dive right in, the 
walkthrough in C# is as good of a place as any.  


Licensing and Redistribution
----------------------------
See the End User License Agreement (EULA) in the file eula.rtf, and the 
License Express™ User's Guide in the file licXUsersGuide.doc for 
information on licensing and redistribution.  

In general, you must purchase one license for each product that is 
licensed with the License Express™ technology.  A product is distinguished 
by a name and major revision number.  Products that have the same name and 
major revision number but different minor revision numbers and or build 
numbers are considered the same product.  

The only redistributable files are licX.dll and licX.msm, though further 
explanations and limitations are in the EULA and User's Guide.


What's New?
-----------

Version 1.4 contains the following enhancements over version 1.3:

    in C# was added. 
  - All VB examples were rebuild in Visual Studio .NET 2003
  - Minor cosmetic changes to KeyGen, KeyGenWin, and the License Installer tool.

Version 1.3 contains the following enhancements over version 1.2:

  - Different licensing.
  - Developed a new License Installer tool which is used to automatically replace 
    an evaluation license with a retail license.  Before, the end user had to do 
    this manually which left open a window for error.
  - KeyGenWin was changed to save settings between sessions, and ensure that the 
    evaluation license restrictions are enforced.  

Version 1.2 contains the following enhancements over version 1.1:

  - Support for embedding expiration dates in license key strings.
  - Graphical license key generation utility (KeyGenWin.exe) added.

  - Support for applications and non-Component-derived classes.  Previous versions 
    of License Express™ only worked with .NET components.  This version supports the 
    licensing of any .NET class at all.
  - "Nag During Evaluation" option.  A simple way to put up 'nag' screens during a 
    product's evaluation.
  - Misc. documentation updates and corrections.
