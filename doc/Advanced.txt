Features
--------

- Allow use of registry keys for storing license key string.
- Allow license key strings to have expiration dates burned in.
	[this is requested by andrew@delve.net].
	[I promised this to him for the next version].
- Add documentation for licensing non-component classes like
  executables.  Add docs for Web Controls.
- Add more explanation on what component developers need to do to make
  sure their customers don't have any problems.  i.e., licX.dll needs
  to be copied with their component assembly.

Bugs
-----
1. If a component doesn't have the licXLicensing component embedded in it,
   or if it is static or otherwise inaccessible through reflection, it
   will trap during Validate().
2. If a .LIC file is present, it will be used at runtime even if another
   license is embedded in the executable.  This is Bad, because the license
   might be an eval license that is supposed to expire.

Advanced Functionality
----------------------
- All of Simple's functionality.
- Optional license activation.
- Record licensee's identity (through activation) to remind user.
- Allow product code to be embedded in license string (so that a single binary
  product can behave differently depending on the product code).
- Public key support for strong-signed license key strings.  Allow
  customer name to be 'burned' into license string.

Custom Solutions with Source Code
---------------------------------
- Full source to LicX Advanced.
- Custom programming to implement exactly the license scheme you want.
